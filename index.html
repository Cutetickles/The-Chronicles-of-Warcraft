<p class="sitat">Wotlk.. Nothing beats the soporific tedious on-the-other-end-of-the-map-scattered tasks that the Argent Crusade sends us on.
    Or those overnight pulled in a row, farming for the all to shy time lost dragon. 
    Only to fall off your mount mid-air when you actually see him.</p>
<p class="TBC">The Burning Crusade- You Are Now Prepared! Or you should be...This expansion is over 15-year-olds!</p>
<p class="mist">Mist- Answer me this and : Why do we fight? If your answer isn't 'To protect Home, and Family. To preserve Balance, and bring Harmony' You can probably just leave</p>
<p class="cata">I have given Cataclusm a place on the list of most farmidable (pun intended) expansions made. 
    Given the hours and miles spent on character running in cirles reapetedly killing, looting, sell trash... Not to menation the neverending mace called Blackrock Depths(ㆆ_ㆆ)  
    BuUuUuut... I won't. -Zog Zog  </p>
